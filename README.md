# Games of the Month

## The premise

Game development is a passion of mine, but it's also a multi-faceted and deep process. It's as complicated as it is varied, and I want to give myself an avenue to constantly improve my skills and knowledge in this space. I decided to do a fun version of this: monthly dives into different game development topics, so I can give myself time and space to practice my skills as well as learn new aspects of game development to expand my knowledge and abilities.

## The rules

I want this to be a somewhat casual affair, but still with some structure to it. The hope is that by keeping myself to some loose rules I can keep-up my work without stressing myself or making this venture feel like a burdern. As such, I have some loose rules I want to adhere to.

1) **Time commitment.** I'm going to spent a somewhat consistent amount of time working on this each week so that it becomes a regular habit for me, but also so I don't overwork myself. I'll work on this project 3 days a week, for about 2-3 hours per work-session. This means in total I'll work about 6-9 hours each week, which feels like a decent amount of time-spent on honing my skills.

2) **Dev logs.** Throughout each work-session, I'll write a dev log. These logs will have a little life update, that day's goals and my experiences of working throughout the day. The idea here is to show what I'm intending to do each day, as well as my thought process throughout these projects. I want a sense of who I am and how I work to come through these dev logs, so I'll be writing them in a fairly casual manner. Think of it as free-flow thought for these as I write about how the project is going.

## The goals

I want to learn and grow with these projects, while also having fun. This might be prototyping an idea I really like, or even just exploring a topic I've been interested in. Heck, I might even use this to shore-up some skills I think would help my career in the future! The biggest idea with this endeavor is that it's flexible and productive. As long as I'm learning and challenging myself, I'll consider this effort a success.
