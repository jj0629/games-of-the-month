## Twelfth day of work

### Intro

Kennywood was a lot of fun! It was pouring for a bit while we were there, but we got to do almost every ride we wanted! So I think it was a success overall. With that, the weekend shouldn't be much busier, outside of a small event I'm going to tomorrow called Tacomania. I'm excited for good tacos!

### Goal

Today is the final day for this month. As such, I'm hoping to fix some bugs with particles and just get things in a good, working state. That'll be all for today!

### End of Day write-up

I spent some more time debugging. I think I have everything set to as it was beforehand, however my graphics debugger (the built-in d3d11 one in visual studio 2019) is giving me a strange error that it can't build the shader traces so the debugging process fails. It's quite annoying, however I'm not sure what's causing this issue in particular. My shaders are all good, they compile and (somewhat) work!

I'm so exhausted however I might just need to throw in the towel for tonight and try again tomorrow. I'm just not sure what's going on with this bug.
