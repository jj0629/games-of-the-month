## Eleventh day of work

### Intro

Not much happened today. It's going to be a mostly quiet week, so I think I'm going to enjoy the calm as much as I can.

### Goal

So I know what my final problem is: properly dispatching vertex shaders. The solution? Still have no clue. Apparently you can discard pixel shader results, which might be useful, but I'll need to find a way to tell the pixel shader to discard. This also doesn't feel like a very performant way of doing things, but it is a way.

### End of Day write-up

I decided to try the above method. It uh...doesn't work. I'm going to have to try something else, but I'm really not sure what the play is.

I think I'm going to need to reconsider this paradigm. I've already sunk a lot of time into it, and I think it's just fundamentally a bad idea. I'm happy I got to learn some interesting shader and memory tricks while implementing GPU-side emitters, but unfortunately there's just too many issues with my initial setup that I'd have to redesign things even more to get it working. As such, I think I'm going to revert the emitter changes to a previous thing and leave it there.
