## Post Mortem

### Impressions

What a month it was! So many things happened, and I learned a lot about the Unreal Engine! I'm glad that I finally took the time to tackle this beast of an engine, and begin to learn the basics of it. There are so many more things I want to explore and learn, but just having a basis of knowledge to use is going to help a lot. There were many trials and tribulations, but overall I like the engine a lot!

### What I made

In this month, I made a basic flying prototype for Flight Bikes. It has basic 3D flight movement, basic camera controls and some extra reset/respawn buttons. The bike generates walls behind it, with collision that can kill the player. There is also a very basic UI that displays player information and instructions as the game goes on.

### What I learned

While I didn't complete much in the grand scheme of things, I learned a lot while doing my work. I have a much better handle on how UE5 handles blueprints, inputs and its UI as well. I also managed to learn about a lot of the engine's basic classes, how those interact with the engine as a whole, and generally how to navigate the windows and panels of the editor. I also learned many functions to use in blueprints, and generally find my way around doing basic actions.

As I write things out, it doesn't seem like I learned much, but it feels different. I feel much more comfortable navigating and using the engine, which I think will go a long way towards future work and projects. The most important thing here for me is I have my foot in the door and a way forward if I want to work in UE5 again.

### Conclusion

Overall this month was a wonderful experience! I stuck to my schedule, and made a lot of progress and learned a lot in a way I'm very proud of. I'm also extremely excited for next month's project, and to see what I can make moving-forward!
