## Project Description

Graphics programming is a huge passion of mine, so I want to spend some more time on it. There's a lot I want to do here with this personal engine of mine I've had for a few years, and I figured this would be a good place to improve and explore myself in the space of graphics programming. As such, this month will be quite a visual one!


## Project Goal

The goal here is to take the engine I have, and add more to it while improving what's there. As it stands there are a few areas I want to make improvements and fixes to. Here is just a short list of what I want to do:

- My depth-of-field shader doesn't properly blur objects when they're too close. The GUI parameters don't also get sent to the shader properly.

- I want to improve the structure and code of my ImGUI panels, so that they're more orderly and easier to modify in the future. As it stands, it's difficult to navigate.

- I would like to add an asset manager. I have one in my DX12 engine, which reads JSON files and generates code as-needed then binds that code to human-readible strings. This makes managing assets and objects within the engine while I'm developing super easy, as I can call shaders with a string name instead of juggling references in-the-moment.

- I want to try some new graphical techniques. One that I've really fallen in love with is Chromatic Aberration. I love how it looks, and I'd like to implement that into my own engine.

- Compute shaders. This is a high-priority one. I want to explore how these types of shaders work, how I can use them, and hopefully implement them into my engine in some way. I'm not sure how I'd use them yet, but hopefully I can find something.

## Learning Goal

The two big things with this month are learning compute shaders, and re-exploring graphics programming. I'm a little rusty on this, so I want to shore-up my skills and get reacclimated to the work. As such, those are my main two learning goals for this month.
