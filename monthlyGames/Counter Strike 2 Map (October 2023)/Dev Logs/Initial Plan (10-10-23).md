## Life Update

As I'm sure you've noticed, there's a bit of a jump; from July to October. Where did the past two months go? Well, I moved! No longer do I live with my parents, I now live on my own in New York City! The big apple! As such, I needed a few months break to solidify the move, actually do the move and settle into my new apartment. Now that things have begun to settle down, I think I have enough time to return to this monthly project.

## Project Description

This time around, I wanted to try some level design. I think it'll be a fun change of pace, and I have some inspiration for what I'm going to do!

My friends and I have been playing a LOT of counter strike recently. And with the very recent release of counter strike 2, I think now would be a fun time to learn the new hammer editor and make a map for the game!

## Project Goal

The goal here is to make a full-functional defusal map for Counter Strike 2 that I can play with my friends. I want to try to go through a few iterations of the map, and hone-in on an interesting and fun-to-play map.

## Challenges

There are a few quirks with this month's project that will alter how I work on it. 

The first is, as of October 10th, I don't have a GPU capable of fully building and compiling maps for the game. I can test it and do a quick-build, but I can't actually publish my work or anything yet. I'm planning on building a new computer this weekend actually, so I'm hoping this won't be a long-lasting issue, and things will be sorted by next Monday.

Second, I need playtesters for this. As such, that will likely limit how much time I have to work on this map, since I'll need other people to play it and give me feedback on the map itself. I think the feedback will be extremely valuable, but the tradeoff is that it'll take time to get that feedback.

Third, I've already started work on this map a few weeks ago. That  means that I've got a prototype ready to test and run, I just haven't been writing a dev log with it or really keeping track of my progress.

Finally, the tools are very new and unfinished. Because of this, it might take time for me to fully-understand them, or even get certain map elements working as the hammer 2 editor doesn't have a lot of documentation yet. There's also no scripting language yet (aside from the input/outputs system that I still don't understand).

## Learning Goal

The two main things I want to learn are more level design principals (for a tactical FPS like counter strike) and how to use the hammer 2 editor. I suspect with source 2 becoming more and more available, it'll be a good thing to know how to use it and make content with it. Especially if the success and pervasiveness of Source 1 is anything to go by.
